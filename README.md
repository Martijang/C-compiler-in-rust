# C compiler written in rust

My toy porject to create C compiler in rust

--- 
    WARN: current lexer does not support all the keywords in C

## todo:
1. Implement parser for compiler
2. Design my own IR 
3. Implement IR generation
4. asm generation for windows x86_64

### What has been done:
- [OK] parsing cli args
- [OK] lexer 
- [] parser
- [] IR generation
- [] asm translation
